  <h1>How to get JavaFX to work with IntelliJ.</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>If you are taking the class DAPE1400 Programming at OsloMet,
    you will need to use JavaFX together with IntelliJ to study
    the topic of graphical interfaces with Java.
    Unfortunately, JavaFX is not being included in JDK past version 1.8.
    This means that you have two options.
    The first is to install a version of JDK that is 1.8 or earlier and
    select that every time you want to create JavaFX project.
    The other option is to install OpenJFX and perform a series of operations
    every time you want to create a JavaFX project.
